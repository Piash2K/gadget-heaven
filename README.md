## ⚛️ React Fundamentals Used in the Project

This project demonstrates the following fundamental React concepts:

1. **Components and Props**
   Reusable components are created to structure the UI efficiently, and props are used to pass data between components.

2. **State Management**
   React’s `useState` hook is used to manage local component state, handle user interactions, and conditionally render UI elements.

3. **React Context API**
   Context API is used for global state management, allowing data to be shared across multiple components without prop drilling.

4. **React Router**
   `react-router-dom` is implemented to handle client-side routing, creating a smooth multi-page experience within a single-page application.

## 🗂️ Data Handling and Management

The application manages data using the following approaches:

* **Context API**
  Used as the primary data management solution to provide global access to shared data.

* **CartProduct Context**
  Stores and manages products added to the shopping cart, enabling users to add, remove, and sort cart items globally.

* **WishProduct Context**
  Manages wishlist products, making wishlist data easily accessible and manageable throughout the application.
